### First order univariate derivatives

In your R Markdown document, find the derivative expression and slope at the indicated value for each the following functions in R (each in a separate code chunk).

A: $f(x)=x^2$
```{r}
fx <- expression(x^2)

df_dx <- D(expr = fx, name = 'x')

x <- 3
eval(expr = df_dx)
```

B: $f(x)=x^2$
