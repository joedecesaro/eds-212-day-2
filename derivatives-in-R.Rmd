### First order univariate derivatives

In your R Markdown document, find the derivative expression and slope at the indicated value for each the following functions in R (each in a separate code chunk).

A: $f(x)=x^2$ at x=3
```{r}
fx <- expression(x^2)

df_dx <- D(expr = fx, name = 'x')

x <- 3
eval(expr = df_dx)
```

B: $P(a)=2(3a+2)^4-5$ at a=1.2
```{r}
Pa <- expression(2 * (3 * a + 2) ^4 - 5)

dP_da <- D(expr = Pa, name = 'a')

a <- 1.2
eval(expr = dP_da)
```
